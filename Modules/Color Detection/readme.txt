This python module uses opencv and webcolors (webcolors==1.11.1) to detect the average color in the image. For future scope I will be limiting the region to detect the color to a clothing item. 
Steps to use module:
1. run the .py file (Note: You should have a webcam to make this work)
2. press "space" to detect the average color on the screen. 
3. press "escape" to close the program. 

You can hold up different colored objects close to the camera to detect the color. Ensure that it covers most of the field of view of the camera as the program only detects the most dominant color.
